Scrum is a framework for optimizing decision making based on the knowledge and experience of the entire team.\n\nScrum is a methodology where you can pick and choose which parts of Scrum you think will work for your environment.\n\nScrum is meant to be implemented as prescribed (規定的) in the Scrum Guide. For example, the five events in the Scrum Guide are mandatory (強制性的), each event has a specific purpose.\nThe purpose of a Sprint is to produce a done increment of working product.\n\nScrum 理論Upon what type of process control is Scrum based?\n\nEmpirical (經驗主義)\n\nThe three pillars of empirical process control are:\n\n\nInspection (檢視性)\nTransparency (透明性)\nAdaptation (調適性)\n\n\nScrum TeamWho is on the Scrum Team?\n\n\nThe Scrum Master\nThe Product Owner\nThe Development Team\n\n\nScrum does not have a role called “project manager.”\n\nTrue\n\nWhat is the role of Management in Scrum?\n\nSupport the Product Owner with insights (見解) and information into high value product and  (系統功能). Support the Scrum Master to cause organizational change that fosters (扶植) empiricism (經驗主義), self-organization, bottom-up intelligence (自下而上的情報), and intelligent release of software (智能發布軟件).\n\nDuring a Sprint, a Development Team determines that it will not be able to finish the complete forecast. Who should be present to review and adjust the Sprint work selected?\n\nThe Product Owner and the Development Team.\n\nDevelopment TeamThe Development Team should have all the skills needed to:\n\nTurn the Product Backlog items it selects into an increment of potentially releasable product functionality.\n\nWho is responsible for managing the progress of work during a Sprint?\n\nThe Development Team\n\nThe CEO asks the Development Team to add a “very important” item to a Sprint that is in progress. What should the Development Team do?\n\nInform the Product Owner so he/she can work with the CEO.\n\nDevelopment Team membership should change:\n\nAs needed, while taking into account a short term reduction in productivity (減少產能).\n\nWhat is the recommended size for a Development Team (within the Scrum Team)?\n\n3 to 9\n\nHow much work must a Development Team do to a Product Backlog item it selects for a Sprint?\n\nAs much as it has told the Product Owner will be done for every Product Backlog item it selects in conformance with the definition of “Done”.\n\nProduct OwnerWhich statement best describes a Product Owner’s responsibility?\n\nOptimizing (優化) the value of the work the Development Team does.\n\nWho should know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain the alternatives most clearly?\n\nThe Product Owner\n\nWho has the final say on the order of the Product Backlog?\n\nThe Product Owner\n\nScrum MasterWhich of the following services are appropriate for a Scrum Master in regard to the Daily Scrum?\n\nTeach the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15 minute time-box.\n\nWhat is the main reason for the Scrum Master to be at the Daily Scrum?\n\nHe or she does not have to be there; he or she only has to ensure the Development Team has a Daily Scrum.\n\nWhat are the two primary ways a Scrum Master keeps a Development Team working at its highest level of productivity?\n\n\nBy facilitating (促進) Development Team decisions\nBy removing impediments (障礙) that hinder (阻礙) the Development Team\n\n\nScrum 事件The SprintWhen might a Sprint be abnormally cancelled?\n\nWhen the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete (過時的/不合時宜).\n\nWhen is a Sprint over?\n\nWhen the time-box expires.\n\nThe length of a Sprint should be:\n\n\nShort enough to keep the business risk acceptable to the Product Owner.\nShort enough to be able to synchronize (同步化) the development work with other business events.\nNo more than one month.\n\n\nThe purpose of a Sprint is to produce (生產) a done increment (增量) of working product.\n\nTrue\n\nIt is mandatory (強制性的) that the product increment be released to production at the end of each Sprint.\n\nFalse. The product increment should be usable and releasable at the end of every Sprint, but it does NOT have to be released.\n\nSprint PlanningThe time-box for the Sprint Planning meeting is?\n\n8 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.\n\nDaily ScrumWho is required to attend the Daily Scrum?\n\nThe Development Team.\n\nWhy is the Daily Scrum held at the same time and same place?\n\nThe consistency (一致性) reduces complexity (複雜).\n\nThe time-box for a Daily Scrum is?\n\n15 minutes.\n\nSprint Review\nIt is when the Scrum Team and stakeholders (利害關係人) inspect the outcome of a Sprint (檢視此 sprint 成果) and figure out what to do next.\n\nThe maximum length of the Sprint Review (its time-box) is:\n\n4 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.\n\nSprint RetrospectiveThe Scrum Team should choose at least one high priority process improvement, identified during the Sprint Retrospective, and place it in the Product Backlog.\n\nFalse, to ensure continuous improvement, the Sprint Backlog rather than the Product Backlog includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Sprint Retrospective meeting.\n\nThe maximum length of the Sprint Retrospective (its time-box) is:\n\n3 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.\n\nScrum ArtifactsProduct BacklogThe Product Backlog is ordered by:\n\nWhatever is deemed most appropriate by the Product Owner.\n\nHow much work must a Development Team do to a Product Backlog item it selects for a Sprint?\n\nAs much as it has told the Product Owner will be done for every Product Backlog item it selects in conformance with the definition of “Done”.\n\nSprint BacklogWhen does a Development Team member become the sole owner of a Sprint Backlog item?\n\nNever. All Sprint Backlog Items are “owned” by the entire Development Team, even though each one may be implemented by an individual development team member.\n\nThe Sprint Backlog is fully formulated in the Sprint Planning meeting and does not change during the Sprint.\n\nThe Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. The Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.\n\n承諾：完成之定義When many Development Teams are working on a single product, what best describes the definition of “Done?”\n\nAll Development Teams must have a definition of “Done” that makes their combined work potentially releasable.\n\nWho creates the definition of “Done”?\n\nThe development organization (or Development Team if none is available from the development organization)\n\nOthersAn organization has decided to adopt Scrum, but management wants to change the terminology (術語) to fit with terminology already used. What will likely happen if this is done?\n\n\nWithout a new vocabulary (詞彙) as a reminder of the change, very little change may actually happen.\nThe organization may not understand what has changed with Scrum and the benefits of Scrum may be lost.\nManagement may feel less anxious (焦慮).\n\n\nWhat does it mean to say that an event has a time-box?\n\nThe event can take no more than a maximum amount of time.\n\n參考資料\nScrum Guide\nScrum online Test\n\n","dateCreated":"2020-12-06T00:00:00+08:00","dateModified":"2020-12-06T00:00:00+08:00","datePublished":"2020-12-06T00:00:00+08:00","description":"公司突然說要 Scrum 考試，只好卯起來讀書了。找了線上考題練習，參考 Scrum Guide 把筆記整理在這篇。","headline":"Scrum - 2020 Guide Study","image":["https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/986819/scrum_d2100y.png","https://www.obscuregames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-steps-of-scrum-1.jpg"],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://annilla.github.io/2020/12/06/Others/Scrum-2020-Guide-Study/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Anny Chang","sameAs":["https://github.com/Annilla","https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002453201106"],"image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/374893f797cb60493c52ee173d81808f","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/374893f797cb60493c52ee173d81808f"}},"url":"http://annilla.github.io/2020/12/06/Others/Scrum-2020-Guide-Study/","keywords":"Scrum","thumbnailUrl":"https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/986819/scrum_d2100y.png"}</script>

</blockquote>
<p><del>Scrum is a framework that eliminates complexity.</del></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrum offers a framework for <strong>dealing with complexity NOT eliminates (消除) complexity.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>Scrum is like traditional processes but with self-organization to replace Project Managers.</del></p>

</blockquote>
<p><del>Scrum is a methodology where you can pick and choose which parts of Scrum you think will work for your environment.</del></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scrum is meant to be implemented as prescribed (規定的) in the Scrum Guide.</strong> For example, the five events in the Scrum Guide are mandatory (強制性的), each event has a specific purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose of a Sprint is to produce a done increment of working product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Support the Product Owner with insights (見解) and information into high value product and  (系統功能). Support the Scrum Master to cause organizational change that fosters (扶植) empiricism (經驗主義), self-organization, bottom-up intelligence (自下而上的情報), and intelligent release of software (智能發布軟件).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During a Sprint, a Development Team determines that it will not be able to finish the complete forecast. Who should be present to review and adjust the Sprint work selected?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Product Owner and the Development Team.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Development-Team"><a href="#Development-Team" class="headerlink" title="Development Team"></a>Development Team</h2><p>The Development Team should have all the skills needed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn the Product Backlog items it selects into an increment of potentially releasable product functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is responsible for managing the progress of work during a Sprint?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Development Team</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Inform the Product Owner so he/she can work with the CEO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Development Team membership should change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 to 9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much work must a Development Team do to a Product Backlog item it selects for a Sprint?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as it has told the Product Owner will be done for every Product Backlog item it selects in conformance with the definition of “Done”.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Product-Owner"><a href="#Product-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Product Owner"></a>Product Owner</h2><p>Which statement best describes a Product Owner’s responsibility?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimizing (優化) the value of the work the Development Team does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who should know the most about the progress toward a business objective or a release, and be able to explain the alternatives most clearly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Product Owner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who has the final say on the order of the Product Backlog?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He or she does not have to be there; he or she only has to ensure the Development Team has a Daily Scrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the two primary ways a Scrum Master keeps a Development Team working at its highest level of productivity?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>By facilitating (促進) Development Team decisions</li>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete (過時的/不合時宜).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When is a Sprint over?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The length of a Sprint should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Short enough to be able to synchronize (同步化) the development work with other business events.</li>
<li>No more than one month.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of a Sprint is to produce (生產) a done increment (增量) of working product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is mandatory (強制性的) that the product increment be <del>released</del> to production at the end of each Sprint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>False. The product increment should be usable and releasable at the end of every Sprint, but <strong>it does NOT have to be released</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Sprint-Retrospective"><a href="#Sprint-Retrospective" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Retrospective"></a>Sprint Retrospective</h2><p>The Scrum Team should choose at least one high priority process improvement, identified during the Sprint Retrospective, and place it in the <del>Product Backlog</del>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>False, to ensure continuous improvement, the Sprint Backlog rather than the Product Backlog includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Sprint Retrospective meeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The maximum length of the Sprint Retrospective (its time-box) is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><del>The Sprint Backlog is fully formulated in the Sprint Planning meeting and does not change during the Sprint.</del></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. The Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="承諾：完成之定義"><a href="#承諾：完成之定義" class="headerlink" title="承諾：完成之定義"></a>承諾：完成之定義</h2><p>When many Development Teams are working on a single product, what best describes the definition of “Done?”</p>

</blockquote>
<h1 id="Others"><a href="#Others" class="headerlink" title="Others"></a>Others</h1><p>An organization has decided to adopt Scrum, but management wants to change the terminology (術語) to fit with terminology already used. What will likely happen if this is done?</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Without a new vocabulary (詞彙) as a reminder of the change, very little change may actually happen.</li>
<li>The organization may not understand what has changed with Scrum and the benefits of Scrum may be lost.</li>
<li>Management may feel less anxious (焦慮).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
